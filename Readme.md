This is my custom JavaScript game engine, with support for 2D and 3D rendering (WebGL), Virtual Reality (WebXR), OBJ model loading using a custom parser, dev console, event system and more.

An online demo is [available here](https://sandbox.reynisal.com).

## Games Developed in Rey Web Engine

I've developed two games using the Rey Web Engine, a demo 3D project, "Sandbox" and a 2D top-down game, "Throttle Ball".

The project has two scripts defined, one for each project.

These scripts can be run using the command `npm run sandbox` or `npm run throttleball`.
